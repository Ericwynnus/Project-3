# Introduction 
## The release of Axie Infinity gaming ecosystem by Sky Mavis introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. To gamers this was their Holy Grail; playing games while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now multiple play to earn games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can. You now you want to be a mideviel King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can. Get dropped into a zombie filled world and have to shoot your way to freedom? Explore outerspace, and see strange new worlds. There is a game for that.

## What seperate "play to earn" games from your typical online games by such  companies as Blizzard Entertainment (World of Warcraft) or Microsoft (Halo) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to create unique, one of kind, characters that they own and can develop to their unique interest; Online gaming pieces can be outfitted with special spells, tokens, armor, or weapons that are centrally unique to them and no other. The owners of these NFT characters are then able to sell, trade, exchange, or retire their characters as they see fit within the gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange the character NFT's allows for the commodization of these NFT's in the same manner that corn, silver, gold, stocks or bonds are traded everyday with their respective platforms and exchanges.
