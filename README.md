# History 
The release of the [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis](https://www.skymavis.com/) introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. A concept now known as "play to earn". To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail moment. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. 

The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now dozens of "play to earn" games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can with [Gods Unchained](). You want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can in [CityStates: Medieval](https://citystatesm.com/). How about getting dropped into a zombie filled world were you have to shoot your way to freedom? You can do that with [Zombie Rising]()? What about exploring outer space, and seeing strange new worlds? [Alien Worlds](https://alienworlds.io/) will take you there and beyond. 

What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online, massive multiple player online games by such companies as [Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/) or [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique characters, BUT, they then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. 

The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, their NFT's as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange these objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of such in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective public exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. 

As with all free markets, at times supply and demand factors can cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer resulting in extreme inflationary pressures. This inflationary specter caused the world of the Axies to become exorbitantly expensive (reaching a peak of $1,500.00 for a starter set) and thus shutting out many willing players who could not afford the startup costs. And, if you are in a local economy where you are making only a few dollars a day, that magical set of Axies that costs $1,500.00 US dollars might as well be a million dollars. It is just too expensive for you to purchase to play a game when those dollars would go a long way to feeding your family.

And, here-in lies the business opportunity.


# The Business Model
Does Dick Sporting Goods create games? Or, do they sell the equipment to you to have fun playing a game?

Does United Rentals build buildings? Or, do they rent the equipment to contractors to build great buildings?

A business could operate within the "play to earn" gaming environments acquiring assets, lands, characters, and other in-game non-fungible tokens. The business could then act as a material goods "Lender" to players who cannot afford the upfront costs of such gaming NFT's. The "Lendee" player's character could now be outfitted with sufficient in-game resources that they could play at an above average starting point making their game play more rewarding than those who simply "boot-strap" themselves into the game ecosystem(s) starting from scratch. 

In order to incentivize such an arrangement, the Lender/Lendee (as an example) could split the in-game earnings 30/70. Thirty percent going to the "Lender‚Äù and seventy percent going to the "Lendee." If a player tires of the gaming ecosystem they simply surrender the borrowed assets the same way as one would return a library book to their local library. The player keeps their seventy percent of the earnings and any other tokens they accumulated, and everyone leaves the game a winner. If the player decides they want to play within another gaming ecosystem they could come back to the "Lender" and simply "check-out" another character or other specialized tokens and explore the next "play to earn" world and again split their respective earnings with the "Lending" entity.


# Machine Learning Demonstration
Why is Machine Learning important for this business model? 

As more and more "play to earn" games emerge it stands to reason those gamers will move from one ecosystem to another till they find one game(s) that best meets their playing needs. Using Machine Learning we can use predictive modeling to help us understand the direction of the games market share (growing or shrinking user base/interest) which can help to indicate whether or not to buy or sell NFT assets within that gaming ecosystem. 

Using Machine Learning we wanted to understand the pricing predictive models of four "play to earn" games that are publicly traded (Coinbase or KuCoin). We chose the following four games:
1. [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/)
2. [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)
3. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/)
4. [Pegaxy](https://pegaxy.io/)

With Machine Learning, we found that all four gaming tokens are below their expected predicted valuations. Furthermore, they each demonstrate an ongoing downward trend, which could signal a warning. However, in our current economic environment, all assets are experiencing unique stressors during this period of turmoil. Even stalwart investments such as Facebook, Apple, and many others have seen severe reductions in their stock market valuations. 

In the folder labeled "Machine Learning" are the four CSV files for the above noted tokens.  Each was run using the Tensor Flow modeling. The CSV's were derived from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKXROKVwGzTyekoPeZxp1NhMZQ_30RSAq3n6_Y4Gz9o4Wbz3bltWbwnWi5qacicHVUt-7_YeEiIqUgZ_36eqfm3t1EAYvReYedHm_KwNm9beBlhFgza6y06oDb7feC9RC2bx22IhbJIUMyTIkiLi4saqO2ASbbe7UbPspOYuzeL8)

# Recommendation Engine (New Technology)
What are Recommendation Engines?

We have all seen recommendation engines at work; shop on Amazon, watch movies on Netflix, surf the web much? Recommendation Engines are software that take the data that you input into website and return a recommendation based on your interests. The concept is easy; it is vendor upselling in an effort to get you too spend more before you leave there website.

For example, you are building an adventure character in the world of [Cryptoblades](Cryptoblades.io) and you need a magical sword. You input that you need to borrow a +3 broadsword. Our Recomendation engine sees that and also recommends from our inventory of good, a magical bow and arrow, some mystical battle armor and maybe a enchanted helmet to finish outfitting your character. As these items are "borrowed" you now have a character more advanced than when you first started with building your character, and now better able to handle the upcoming quest to kll the infamous red dragon. You rewards are higher and using our 70/30 split, the business revenue is higher.

We have added a recommendation engine to interepert consumer imports and derive a recommendation export.The KNN Algorithim (K-Nearest Neighbor) is used for classification and looks to assigns new data based on on how close or similiar the data is to the points in the training data. With this example  was found during research and is modeled using a CSV file from [Steam](store.steampowered.com) that uses their customer base to and based on their inputs to present similiar games that the customer may want to play.

# Crowdfunding Demonstration
Why is crowdfunding important?

All business need to raise funding at some point. Once a founders(s) personal investment has been used up additional sources of funding are needed till such time that the business model is able to sufficiently fund itself and supply a steady stream of capital. Crowdfunding is a viable fund-raising strategy as it allows for the company to present their business model to a community of potential investors who can then "stress test" the business concept and provide immediate feedback to the founding team: Is the concept investable? What is public sentiment about the business model? Would investors turn into customers?

WIth that in mind, we have developed a token that is mintable and able to be crowdsourced. 

In the folder labeled "Crowdfunding" you will find our program for this token to be crowdfunding. 

## Sample Crowdfunding


# Non-Fungible Token Demonstration
Why create our own non-fungible tokens?

All consumer based business now employ a "rewards" program to encourage and incentivise customers to return. We would like create our own non-fungible tokens that we could present to our customers as a reward system. Within these non-fungible tokens we could attach recognition for a job well done, coupon codes for NFT purchases, collectible tokens, or any other method of recognizing a customers attention and thanking them.

In the folder labeled "Non-Fungible Tokens you will find our code for five non-funigble tokens.

# Play to Earn Games
This field is exploding as more and more projects seek to emulate the success of Axie Infinity and Decentraland. A current list along with the project capitilizations can be found at this link, [Coin Gecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/play-to-earn)


# Gaming Guilds
Gaming Guilds are collectives of indivduals who have pulled their resources to stake and provide scholarships to other "play to earn" gamers. These generally operate as DAO's (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, is a blockchain-based protocol with rules enforced by smart contracts, which are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. DAOs can have several purposes, but their main function is to provide an automated way to carry out governance decisions voted on by its members using a governance token. .
