# History 
The release of the [Axie Infinity]() gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis]() introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now multiple play to earn games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can[](). You now you want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can[](). Get dropped into a zombie filled world and have to shoot your way to freedom[]()? Explore outer space, and see strange new worlds[](). There is a game for that.

What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online games by such luminaire companies as [Blizzard Entertainment]() (World of Warcraft) or [Microsoft]() (Halo) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique, one of kind, characters, BUT, they can then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, or retire their characters/images/objects as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange the objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of these gaming NFT's in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, silver, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective platforms and public exchanges. 

As with all free markets, at times supply and demand factors can cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer resulting in an inflationary spiral upwards. This inflationary specter caused the world of Axies to become exorbitantly expensive and shut out many willing participants as they could not raise the cash to purchase the required starter set of three characters to play in the ecosystem. And, this many willing players were shut out, unable to afford the opportunity to play the game. 

And, here in lies the business opportunity.

# Overview (The Lend-Lease Business Model)
An enitity (individual/corporation/decentralised autnomosius dowel) with sufficient reources could operate within the "play to earn" gaming enviroments absorbing assets, lands, characters, and other in-game ecosystem non-fungible tokens. Once sufficient assets are gathered the "lendor" could recruit willing players who cannot afford the upfront costs of such NFT's, and through in-game mechanics they could "lend" the players the needed assets to play on their behalf. The "lendee" player's character could be now be outfitted with sufficient in-game resources that they could play at an above average starting point making their play more rewarding than those who simply "boot-strap" themselves into the game ecosystem(s) starting from scratch. 

In order to incentienvise such an arragenement the player could keep 70% of their earnings and the "lendor" would retain 30% to offset their investment and management costs. If a player tires of the gaming ecosystem they simply surrender their characters NFT, they keep their earnings and everyone leaves a winner. If the player decides they want to play within another gaming ecosysttem they could come back to the "lendor" and simply "check-out" another character and explore the next world and again split their respective earnings with the "lending" lending entity.
