University of Minnesota, FinTech Bootcamp


# Project Description
This project is the capstone project for the University of Minnesota FinTech Bootcamp program. In accordance to the project requirements, the skillsets acquired within class will be demonstrated here. The skillsets demonstrated will encompass the following:
1. Machine Learning.
2. Tokenization.
3. Crowdfunding.
4. Non-fungible token(s).



The end product demonstrated here, will be used as the foundation of a business proposal/plan to be acted upon.

# History 
The release of the [Axie Infinity]() gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis]() introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now multiple play to earn games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can[](). You now you want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can[](). Get dropped into a zombie filled world and have to shoot your way to freedom[]()? Explore outer space, and see strange new worlds[](). There is a game for that.

What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online games by such luminaire companies as [Blizzard Entertainment]() (World of Warcraft) or [Microsoft]() (Halo) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique, one of kind, characters, BUT, they can then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, or retire their characters/images/objects as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange the objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of these gaming NFT's in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, silver, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective platforms and public exchanges. 

As with all free markets, at times supply and demand factors can cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer resulting in an inflationary spiral upwards. This inflationary specter caused the world of Axies to become exorbitantly expensive and shut out many willing participants as they could not raise the cash to purchase the required starter set of three characters to play in the ecosystem. And, this many willing players were shut out, unable to afford the opportunity to play the game. 

And, here in lies the business opportunity.

# Overview (The Lend-Lease Business Model)
An enitity (individual/corporation/decentralised autnomosius dowel) with sufficient reources could operate within the "play to earn" gaming enviroments absorbing assets, lands, characters, and other in-game ecosystem non-fungible tokens. Once sufficient assets are gathered the "lendor" could recruit willing players who cannot afford the upfront costs of such NFT's, and through in-game mechanics they could "lend" the players the needed assets to play on their behalf. The "lendee" player's character could be now be outfitted with sufficient in-game resources that they could play at an above average starting point making their play more rewarding than those who simply "boot-strap" themselves into the game ecosystem(s) starting from scratch. 

In order to incentienvise such an arragenement the player could keep 70% of their earnings and the "lendor" would retain 30% to offset their investment and management costs. If a player tires of the gaming ecosystem they simply surrender their characters NFT, they keep their earnings and everyone leaves a winner. If the player decides they want to play within another gaming ecosysttem they could come back to the "lendor" and simply "check-out" another character and explore the next world and again split their respective earnings with the "lending" lending entity.


# Machine Learning Demonstration
The world economics are currently struggling with slowing economies, rising inflationanry preasures, a persistent pandemic, and a European theater war. All economic assets are under preasure as of this writing. Using machine learning I wanted to understand the pricing perdicitive models of four "play to earn" games and their valuation trajectory. I chose the following four games:
1. Axie Infinty
2. Decentraland
3. Gods Unchained 
4. Pegaxy

Using machine learning, I found that all four assets were below their expected valuations. And furthermore, they each demonstrate an ongoing downward trend.  This is not surprising as all economic assets are exerpincing unique stressors during this period of turmoil. Even stalwart investments such as Facebook, Apple, and others have seen severe reductions in their valuations. 

In addition, gaming enviroments will cannablize one another as players move from gaming ecosystem to gaming ecosystem looking for the gaming enviroment that is best suited to their unique taste (The Goldilocks Effect). 

The advantage to this current economic scenario is that in game NFT's can now be purchased at discounted prices, and some steeply discoiunted. For example, NFT Axies that were selling for hunderds of dollars just last year can now be purchased for as little as $10.00 this year.
