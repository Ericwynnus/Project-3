# History 
The release of the [Axie Infinity]() gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis]() introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process, now known as "play to earn". To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now multiple "play to earn" games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can[](). You now you want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can[](). Get dropped into a zombie filled world and have to shoot your way to freedom[]()? Explore outer space, and see strange new worlds[](). There is a game for that.

What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online, massive multiple palayer online games by such luminaire companies as [Blizzard Entertainment]() (World of Warcraft) or [Microsoft]() (Halo) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique, one of kind, characters, BUT, they can then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, or retire their characters/images/objects as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange these objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of these gaming NFT's in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, silver, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective platforms and public exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade. 

As with all free markets, at times supply and demand factors can cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer resulting in an inflationary spiral upwards. This inflationary specter caused the world of the Axies to become exorbitantly expensive and thus many willing players were shut out as they could not raise the cash to purchase the required starter set of three characters to play. In other "play to earn" games players need to purchase better guns to shoot the attacking zombies, or better shields for their spaceships in flight but all of these gaming non-fungible tokens that offer the upgrades are expensive. And, if you are in a local economy where you are making only a few dollars a day, that magical flaming sword that costs $100.00 US Dollars and could give you the gaming edge you need, well it might as well be a million or even a billion dollars. It is just too expensive for you to purchase to play a game when those $100.00 US dollars would go a long way to feeding your family.

And, here-in lies the business opportunity.

# The Lend-Lease Business Model
An entity with sufficient resources could operate within the "play to earn" gaming environments acquiring assets, lands, characters, and other in-game ecosystem non-fungible tokens. The buyer of these assets could act as material "lender" to players who cannot afford the upfront costs of such gaming NFT's. Using in-game mechanics they could "lend" or "stake" the players the needed assets to play until they can acquire enough resources to play on their own. The "lendee" player's character could now be outfitted with sufficient in-game resources that they could play at an above average starting point making their game play more rewarding than those who simply "boot-strap" themselves into the game ecosystem(s) starting from scratch. 

In order to incentivize such an arrangement, the player could keep 70% of their earnings and the "lender" would retain 30% to offset their investment and management costs. If a player tires of the gaming ecosystem they simply surrender the borrowed assets the same way as one would return a library book to their local library. The player keeps their earnings and any other tokens they accumulated, and everyone leaves the game a winner. If the player decides they want to play within another gaming ecosystem they could come back to the "lender" and simply "check-out" another character or other specialized tokens and explore the next world and again split their respective earnings with the "lending" lending entity.



# Machine Learning Demonstration
Why is Machine Learning important for this business model? As more and more "play to earn" games emerge it stands to reason that gamers will move from one ecosystem to another till they find one game(s) that best meets their playing needs. Using Machine Learning we can use perdicitive modeling to help us understand the direction of the games market share (growing or shrinking user base/interest) which can help to indicate whether or not to buy or sell NFT assets within that gaming ecosystem. 

Using Machine Learning we wanted to understand the pricing predictive models of four "play to earn" games and their valuation trajectory. We chose the following four games which currently have tradeable coins on exchanges such as Coinbase or KuCoin:
1. Axie Infinity
2. Decentraland
3. Gods Unchained 
4. Pegaxy

With Machine Learning, we found that all four gaming tokens were below their expected prediceted valuations. Furthermore, they each demonstrate an ongoing downward trend. This is not surprising as all economic assets are experiencing unique stressors during this period of turmoil. Even stalwart investments such as Facebook, Apple, and many others have seen severe reductions in their stock market valuations. 

In the folder labeled "Machine Learning" our the four CSV files for the above noted tokens.  Each was run using the Tensor Flow modeling. 

## Crowdfunding Demonstration
All business need to have some start up capital.
