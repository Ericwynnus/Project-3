# Introduction 
## The release of the [Axie Infinity]() gaming ecosystem by [Sky Mavis]() introduced the world to the concept of playing games while earning a income in the process. To gamers around the world, this was their Holy Grail. The opportunity to play a game(s) while getting paid to do such; and they flocked to the world of the Axies by the millions. The success of this game and its online ecosystem has not been lost on other gaming developers. Now multiple play to earn games have been released while many others are in development. You want to be a God and rule the world, now you can[](). You now you want to be a medieval King or Queen and lead your armies against other kingdoms, now you can[](). Get dropped into a zombie filled world and have to shoot your way to freedom[]()? Explore outer space, and see strange new worlds[](). There is a game for that.

## What separates "play to earn" games from your typical online games by such luminaire companies as [Blizzard Entertainment]() (World of Warcraft) or [Microsoft]() (Halo) is that these "play to earn" games incorporate non-fungible tokens (NFT) that allow players to not only create unique, one of kind, characters, BUT, they can then own these characters as one would own a piece of art or share of stock in a company. The creator/owner of these NFT characters/images/objects are then able to sell, trade, exchange, or retire their characters/images/objects as they see fit within their respective gaming ecosystem. This unique ability to exchange the objectified NFT's allows for the commoditization of these gaming NFT's in the same manner that individual traders exchange corn, silver, gold, stocks or bonds within their respective platforms and public exchanges. 

## As with all free markets, at times inflationary factors kick in and cause asset prices to rise beyond the grasp of the average consumer. This inflationary specter caused the world of Axies to become exorbitantly expensive and shut out many willing participants as they could not raise the cash to purchase the required starter set of three characters to play in the ecosystem. 

## Here in lies the opportunity.
